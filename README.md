# Baseline comparison
A simple framework strategy for comparing the decision boundary of your model to the ground truth decision boundary of your data.

The underlying idea is based on the prior knowledge of the distribution of your data and is based on the book "Pattern Classification" by Richard O. Duda.

* The file BayesDecisionBoundary describes the theory and intuition behind of pattern classification.
* The file Framework describes the general framework idea.
