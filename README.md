# Baseline comparison
A simple framework strategy for comparing the decision boundary of your model to the ground truth decision boundary of your data.

The underlying idea is based on the prior knowledge of the distribution of your data and is based on concepts of the book "Pattern Classification 2nd Edition", by Richard O. Duda.

* The file [BayesDecisionBoundary](https://github.com/matheusomendonca/baseline_comparison/blob/master/BayesDecisionBoundary.ipynb) describes the theory and intuition behind pattern classification.
* The file [Framework](https://github.com/matheusomendonca/baseline_comparison/blob/master/Framework.ipynb) describes the general framework idea.
